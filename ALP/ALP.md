## Proposal: Integration of ALT (At Live Token) into ALP (ALT Profile) Dapp

### Overview of Proposal:
We propose integrating ALT (At Live Token) into the ALP (ALT Profile) Dapp ecosystem. ALT is an ERC721 token that serves as a protocol for creating decentralized identities for users. By incorporating ALT into ALP, we can leverage its unique features and benefits to enhance user experiences and enable seamless interactions on EVM blockchains.

### Key Features and Benefits:
- **Decentralized Identities**: ALT allows users to create decentralized identities, providing them with control over their personal information and data.
- **Enhanced User Experiences**: By integrating ALT into ALP, users can have a unified and customizable profile that includes their nickname, bio, wallet addresses, social media links, custom types (e.g., website), avatar (IPFS), banner, game achievements, and identity verification badge.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: ALT and ALP are designed to be cross-chain compatible, enabling users to interact seamlessly across different blockchain networks.

### Use Cases for Integration:
- **Social Media Platforms**: ALP can be integrated into social media platforms, allowing users to have a decentralized profile that can be easily shared and verified.
- **Gaming Industry**: Game developers can utilize ALP to create unique profiles for players, showcasing their achievements and providing a seamless experience across different games.
- **Identity Verification**: ALP can be used for identity verification purposes, allowing users to prove their authenticity and credibility in various online interactions.

### Milestones:
1. **Testnet Development** (30 days): Develop and test the integration of ALT into ALP on a testnet environment, ensuring compatibility and functionality.
2. **User Feedback and Iteration** (30 to 45 days): Gather user feedback on the integrated ALP with ALT and make necessary improvements based on the feedback received.
3. **Mainnet Deployment** (30 to 45 days): Deploy the finalized version of ALP with ALT integration on the mainnet, making it available for users to utilize and benefit from.

### Estimated Timeline and Costs:
- **Testnet Development**: 30 days
- **User Feedback and Iteration**: 30 to 45 days
- **Mainnet Deployment**: 30 to 45 days

### Creator Team:
The development team for ALT Ecosystem consists of the core members of Blue Lotus, a blockchain development organization:

- Mosi: Blockchain Engineer and FINTECH Spicialist
- Sepehr: Web3 Developer and DevOps Spicialist
- Omid: Web3 Developer and Frontend Specialist

### Proposal Approach:
1. **Research and Development**: Conduct thorough research on the integration of ALT into ALP, ensuring compatibility and functionality.
2. **Design and Implementation**: Design and implement the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to enable the integration of ALT into ALP.
3. **Testing and Iteration**: Test the integrated ALP with ALT on a testnet environment, gather user feedback, and make necessary improvements based on the feedback received.
4. **Deployment and Launch**: Deploy the finalized version of ALP with ALT integration on the mainnet, making it available for users to utilize and benefit from.

### The ALP Structure:
- ALT: @name
- ALP: key@name:value

### Conclusion:
The integration of ALT into the ALP Dapp ecosystem offers numerous benefits, including enhanced user experiences, decentralized identities, and cross-chain compatibility. By incorporating ALT into ALP, we can create a powerful and versatile platform that empowers users and enables seamless interactions on EVM blockchains.
