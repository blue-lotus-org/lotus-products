## Proposal: Dapp Integration for Decentralized AI for Audit smartcontract

### Overview of Proposal:
We propose integrating a decentralized AI for auditing smart contracts into our Dapp. This AI will provide an automated and efficient way to detect problems and vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The Dapp will not collect any user data, ensuring privacy and security.
- core used **LLaMA** based on "lotus-chain researches"
- version **0.1.0** trained with live smartcontracts launched on ethereum mainnets like a "paranoia detector" - **offline**
- version **0.1.1** trained with live smartcontracts launched on 3 blockchain mainnets and off-chain 400,000 buggy smartcontracts - **launched**
- version **0.1.2** trained with live smartcontracts launched on 16 blockchain mainnets - **process not finish**
- version **0.2.0**: Reverse engineering method. _Not started yet_.

### Key Features and Benefits:
- **Decentralized AI**: The Dapp will leverage a decentralized AI system to analyze smart contracts and identify potential issues.
- **Query-based Analysis**: The initial version, 0.1.1 "aka PET," will use a built-in interpreter to perform line-by-line analysis of smart contracts, enabling precise detection of problems.
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Version 0.1.2 "aka TITAN" will include the PET version and utilize a custom AST and Solidity interpreter to uncover more bugs and warnings.
- **Core Technology**: The Dapp will utilize LLaMA, a technology based on lotus-chain research, as its core framework for auditing smart contracts.
- **Extensive Training**: The AI will be trained on live smart contracts launched on Ethereum mainnets, as well as on 3 blockchain mainnets and 16 blockchain mainnets, ensuring comprehensive coverage and accuracy.
- **Paranoia Detector**: Version 0.1.0 of the AI will act as a paranoia detector, identifying potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
- **Bug Fixing**: The Dapp will continuously evolve based on user feedback, with dedicated development phases for fixing bugs and improving performance.
- **Next Version (0.2.0)**: Use OP-CODE and binaries from bytecodes of compiled smartcontracts to detect the vulnerability. Reverse engineering method.

### Audience:
Our target market includes investors, producers, customers, and businesses that want to ensure their smart contracts are secure. Our MVP (Version 0.1.1) is focused on small businesses and developers, while the AI version of our service will focus on more complex smart contracts like DeFi protocols.\
Our target market at Smartcontract Audit includes investors, producers, customers, and businesses that want to ensure their smart contracts are secure.

- **Investors**:\
Investors who hold cryptocurrencies or invest in ICOs are a primary target market for us. They want to ensure that the smart contracts they invest in are secure and free from any vulnerabilities that could lead to financial losses.

- **Producers**:\
Producers who develop smart contracts for their businesses or clients are also a target market for us. They want to ensure that the smart contracts they develop are secure and free from any vulnerabilities that could lead to reputational damage or financial losses.

- **Customers**:\
Customers who use decentralized applications that are powered by smart contracts are also a target market for us. They want to ensure that the smart contracts behind the applications they use are secure and free from any vulnerabilities that could lead to financial losses or data breaches.

- **Businesses**:\
Businesses that use smart contracts to execute transactions or manage their supply chain are also a target market for us. They want to ensure that the smart contracts they use are secure and free from any vulnerabilities that could lead to reputational damage or financial losses.

### Use Cases for Integration:
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: The Dapp will be a valuable tool for developers and auditors to identify and address vulnerabilities in smart contracts before deployment.
- **Security Enhancement**: By integrating the decentralized AI, users can enhance the security of their smart contracts and minimize the risk of potential exploits.

### Milestones:
1. **Beta Development**: Develop and test the initial version of the Dapp, including the PET AI.
2. **User Feedback and Iteration**: Gather user feedback and make necessary improvements to enhance the Dapp's functionality and user experience.
3. **Bug Fixing**: Address any bugs or issues identified during the testing and user feedback phase.
4. **User Feedback and Iteration**: Continue to gather user feedback and iterate on the Dapp to further enhance its performance and features.
5. **Development for New Releases**: Develop and release new versions of the Dapp, including the TITAN AI, to provide more advanced auditing capabilities.

### Estimated Timeline and Costs:
The estimated timeline for the development and integration of the Dapp is as follows:
- **Beta Development**: [x] months
- **User Feedback and Iteration**: [x] month
- **Bug Fixing**: [x] month
- **User Feedback and Iteration**: [x] month
- **Development for New Releases**: [x] months

The estimated costs for the development and integration of the Dapp will depend on the specific requirements and scope of the project. A detailed cost analysis can be provided upon request.

### Creator Team:
- **Mosi**: Blockchain Engineer and FINTECH Specialist
- **Sepehr**: Web3 Developer and DevOps Specialist
- **Omid**: Web3 Developer and Frontend Specialist

### Proposal Approach:
Our approach to integrating the Decentralized AI for Audit smart contract into our Dapp will involve a phased development process, incorporating user feedback and continuous improvement. We will prioritize security, privacy, and usability to ensure a seamless and reliable user experience.

### Conclusion:
By integrating the Decentralized AI for Audit smart contract into our Dapp, we aim to provide developers and auditors with a powerful tool to enhance the security and reliability of their smart contracts. The Dapp will undergo continuous development and improvement based on user feedback, ensuring its effectiveness in detecting and addressing vulnerabilities.
