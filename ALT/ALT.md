## Proposal: Dapp Integration for ALT (At Live Token)

### Overview of Proposal:
This proposal aims to integrate ALT (At Live Token) into a decentralized application (Dapp) ecosystem. ALT is an ERC721 token that serves as a protocol for creating decentralized identities for users. By integrating ALT into a Dapp, we can leverage its unique features and benefits to enhance user experiences and enable seamless interactions on EVM blockchains.

### Key Features and Benefits:
- **Crypto Transactions:** ALT allows users to send and receive cryptocurrencies on EVM blockchains, providing a convenient and secure method for managing digital assets.
- **Text Messaging:** ALT enables users to send and receive text messages on EVM blockchains using the Lotus-ALT protocol, facilitating decentralized communication.
- **Web3 Compatibility:** ALT is web3 products friendly, ensuring compatibility with various web3 features and applications.
- **Simplified Ownership:** Unlike traditional NFTs, ALT eliminates the need for multiple transactions to claim or change ownership. It offers a simple ownership transfer process similar to ERC721 tokens.
- **Lifetime Usage:** ALT offers a one-time purchase for lifetime usage, providing long-term value and utility to users.

### Use Cases for Integration:
- **Decentralized Social Media:** By integrating ALT into a Dapp, we can create a decentralized social media platform where users can interact, share content, and engage in crypto transactions using ALT.
- **Identity Verification:** ALT's decentralized identity protocol can be utilized for identity verification purposes, enabling secure and trustless verification processes within the Dapp ecosystem.
- **Web3 Partnerships:** ALT integration opens up opportunities for partnerships with other web3 projects, allowing users to earn commissions and participate in the growth of the ALT ecosystem.

### Milestones:
1. **Testnet Development (30 days):** Develop and deploy the ALT integration on a testnet environment for thorough testing and refinement.
2. **User Feedback and Iteration (30 to 45 days):** Gather user feedback and iterate on the ALT integration based on user suggestions and requirements.
3. **Mainnet Deployment (30 to 45 days):** Deploy the finalized ALT integration on the mainnet, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

### Estimated Timeline and Costs:
- Testnet Development: 30 days
- User Feedback and Iteration: 30 to 45 days
- Mainnet Deployment: 30 to 45 days

### Creator Team:
The development team for ALT Ecosystem consists of the core members of Blue Lotus, a blockchain development organization:

- Mosi: Blockchain Engineer and FINTECH Spicialist
- Sepehr: Web3 Developer and DevOps Spicialist
- Omid: Web3 Developer and Frontend Specialist

### Proposal Approach:
1. **Research and Planning:** Conduct in-depth research on ALT's technical specifications and integration requirements. Develop a detailed plan for the integration process, including milestones, timeline, and resource allocation.
2. **Development and Testing:** Implement the ALT integration into the Dapp ecosystem, ensuring compatibility and seamless functionality. Conduct thorough testing on testnet environments to identify and resolve any issues or bugs.
3. **User Feedback and Iteration:** Gather user feedback through beta testing and user surveys. Incorporate user suggestions and iterate on the ALT integration to enhance user experiences and address any concerns.
4. **Mainnet Deployment:** Once the ALT integration has been refined based on user feedback, deploy the finalized version on the mainnet, ensuring a secure and reliable user experience.

### Conclusion:
Integrating ALT into a Dapp ecosystem presents exciting opportunities to leverage its unique features and benefits. By enabling crypto transactions, text messaging, and web3 compatibility, ALT can enhance user experiences and facilitate decentralized interactions. The proposed timeline and approach outline a systematic process for integrating ALT into the Dapp ecosystem, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

### Additional information:
ALT used in a separated smartcontract to using decentralized user profile (Called ALP "ALT Profile"). Usecases almost for verify the user identity without publish user private data.\
This is useful for KYC/KYB, decentralized game achievement, verify identity for events/tickets/exchanges/dex's/etc. We are invite you to read more information about this on [LotusChain](https://lotuschain.org) or on the owned proposal (released in this scope/repository: ALP "ALT Profile").
