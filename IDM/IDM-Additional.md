### Additional Information for the ALT IDM Dapp Proposal

To further enhance the Dapp proposal for ALT IDM (Input Data Messages), here are some additional details that can help improve and grow the proposal:

#### User Benefits and Importance of Sending Funds and Text Messages
- By allowing users to send funds and text messages within the Dapp, it provides a convenient and efficient way for blockchain newcomers and experienced users to keep track of their transactions.
- This option addresses a common challenge faced by users on EVM-blockchains, where there is no built-in functionality to associate messages or notes with transactions.
- Users can easily remember the purpose of each transaction and the recipient of the funds, making it easier to manage their financial activities on the blockchain.
- The ability to send funds and text messages creates a public ledger-like experience, where users can view their transaction history and associated messages in a transparent and organized manner.

#### Technical Implementation and Security Considerations
- Implementing proper encryption and authentication mechanisms will be crucial to protect the privacy and security of the text messages exchanged within the Dapp.
- Gas optimization techniques should be employed to minimize the cost of executing transactions and messages within the Dapp.
- In some cases: The Dapp should utilize smart contracts to handle the sending and receiving of funds, ensuring secure and tamper-proof transactions.

#### User Interface and Experience
- The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily compose and send text messages along with funds.
- Users should have the ability to view their transaction history, including the associated text messages, in a clear and organized manner.
- Consider incorporating features such as search and filtering options to allow users to quickly find specific transactions or messages.

#### Marketing and Adoption Strategy
- Develop a comprehensive marketing plan to create awareness and generate interest in the ALT IDM Dapp.
- Collaborate with blockchain communities, influencers, and industry experts to promote the benefits and unique features of the Dapp.
- Provide educational resources and tutorials to help users understand the value and functionality of the Dapp.
- Consider partnerships with existing blockchain platforms or wallets to integrate the ALT IDM Dapp and expand its user base.

#### Phases:
In Phase 1, the transfer of the native token is the only permissible action. However, during Phase 2 of the addition process, other ERC20 tokens will also be eligible for transfer. This sequential approach ensures a systematic and controlled integration of different token types into the system.

- Phase 1: Only the transfer of the native token is permissible.
- Phase 2: In addition to the native token, other ERC20 tokens will be eligible for transfer.
