### Dapp Proposal: ALT IDM (Input Data Messages)

#### Overview
We propose the development and launch of a decentralized application (Dapp) like "Ethereum ALT IDM (Input Data Messages)" on both EVM and Non-EVM blockchains. This Dapp will enable users to send and receive internal messages within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) where the Dapp is deployed. It will be compatible with all EVM blockchains and will be available on both main net and test net environments.

#### Milestones
1. UI/UX: Develop a user-friendly interface specific to each blockchain, similar to a blockchain block explorer.
2. Dapp Compatibility: Ensure the Dapp is compatible with EVM opcodes to ensure seamless execution on all EVM blockchains.
3. Gas Optimization: Implement gas optimization techniques to minimize gas consumption during Dapp execution.

#### Funding Request
We request a minimum in crypto for each milestone, totaling $350,000 for the entire project.
> This costs not included servers after launch the ALT IDM product.

#### Creator Team
The development team for ALT Ecosystem consists of the core members of Blue Lotus, a blockchain development organization:
- Mosi: Blockchain Engineer and FINTECH Spicialist
- Sepehr: Web3 Developer and DevOps
- Omid: Web3 Developer and Frontend Specialist

#### Features
The initial release of ALT IDM will include the following features:
1. ALT IDM Explorer: A user-friendly interface to explore and manage internal messages within the Dapp.
2. Private Messaging: Enable users to send private messages securely within the Dapp.
3. Send Funds with Messages: Allow users to send funds along with a text message, providing a use case for public ledger transactions.
4. ENS Integration: Integrate with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) to enable users to send messages using ENS addresses.
> Features responsibility: Not as a promise, but in future add to dapp with another proposal.

#### Roadmap and Timeline
- Beta Release on Testnet: 30 days after receiving funding.
- Mainnet Launch: 60-90 days after receiving funding.

#### Cost Breakdown
The proposed funding will cover the following costs:
1. Research and Development: Allocation for research and development activities.
2. Team Costs: Compensation for the team members involved in the project.
3. Infrastructure: Expenses related to hosting, servers, and other infrastructure requirements.

#### Production Life-cycle
1. Engineering and Programming: Development and coding phase.
2. Feedback Data Analysis and Development: Analyzing user feedback and implementing improvements in subsequent phases.
3. Test Servers and Access to Functionality: Accessing specific functionality from the curve and utilizing test servers during the development phase.

#### Production Time Scope
- Beta Release â‰ˆ 30 days
- Fix and Upgrade Phase â‰ˆ 30 to 45 days
- Final Release â‰ˆ 30 to 45 days
