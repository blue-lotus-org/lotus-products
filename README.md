| Product/Service | What is it | Read more |
|---|---|---|
| **dCDN** | Decentralized CDN<br /> <sub>We propose the development and integration of a decentralized Content Delivery Network (dCDN) using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The dCDN aims to revolutionize the traditional CDN model by leveraging the decentralized nature of IPFS to provide a more efficient, secure, and scalable content delivery solution.</sub> | [here](https://github.com/blue-lotus-org/lotus-products/tree/main/dCDN) |
| **ALT** | At Live Token<br /> <sub>This proposal aims to integrate ALT (At Live Token) into a decentralized application (Dapp) ecosystem. ALT is an ERC721 token that serves as a protocol for creating decentralized identities for users. By integrating ALT into a Dapp, we can leverage its unique features and benefits to enhance user experiences and enable seamless interactions on EVM blockchains. <br /> [notion](https://glass-raven-25b.notion.site/ALT-Eco-System-49d0645ef12c47d6ba4f18bd1165221d?pvs=4)</sub> | [here](https://github.com/blue-lotus-org/lotus-products/tree/main/ALT) |
| **ALP** | At Live Token Profile<br /> <sub>We propose integrating ALT (At Live Token) into the ALP (ALT Profile) Dapp ecosystem. ALT is an ERC721 token that serves as a protocol for creating decentralized identities for users. By incorporating ALT into ALP, we can leverage its unique features and benefits to enhance user experiences and enable seamless interactions on EVM blockchains. <br /> [notion](https://glass-raven-25b.notion.site/ALT-Eco-System-49d0645ef12c47d6ba4f18bd1165221d?pvs=4)</sub> | [here](https://github.com/blue-lotus-org/lotus-products/tree/main/ALP) |
| **IDM** | All EVM Input Data Messages (IDM)<br /> <sub>We propose the development and launch of a decentralized application (Dapp) like "Ethereum ALT IDM (Input Data Messages)" on both EVM and Non-EVM blockchains. This Dapp will enable users to send and receive internal messages within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) where the Dapp is deployed. It will be compatible with all EVM blockchains and will be available on both main net and test net environments.</sub> | [here](https://github.com/blue-lotus-org/lotus-products/tree/main/IDM) |
| **Audit** | Smartcontract Audit Service (AI)<br /> <sub>We propose integrating a decentralized AI for auditing smart contracts into our Dapp. This AI will provide an automated and efficient way to detect problems and vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The Dapp will not collect any user data, ensuring privacy and security.</sub> | [here](https://github.com/blue-lotus-org/lotus-products/tree/main/Audit) |
