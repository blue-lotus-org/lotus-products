## Roadmap for Decentralized CDN Dapp Proposal

### 1. Research and Analysis
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of existing centralized CDN systems and their limitations.
   - Explore blockchain technology and its potential for decentralized content delivery.
   - Identify the key features and benefits of a decentralized CDN Dapp.
   - Study the challenges and considerations associated with decentralized CDN implementation.

### 2. Define Use Cases and Requirements
   - Identify specific use cases where a decentralized CDN Dapp can provide significant value.
   - Define the functional and non-functional requirements of the Dapp based on the use cases.
   - Determine the desired performance metrics, scalability requirements, and security considerations.

### 3. Design and Architecture
   - Design the overall architecture of the decentralized CDN Dapp, considering factors such as network topology, data storage, content distribution algorithms, and consensus mechanisms.
   - Define the roles and responsibilities of different participants in the network, including content providers, validators, and end-users.
   - <s>Design the smart contracts that govern the interactions and incentives within the Dapp.</s>

### 4. Development and Testing
   - <s>Implement the smart contracts and backend infrastructure required for the decentralized CDN Dapp.</s>
   - Develop the user interface and frontend components for seamless interaction with the Dapp.
   - Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the functionality, security, and performance of the Dapp.
   - Perform load testing to assess the scalability of the decentralized CDN network.

### 5. Deployment and Integration
   - Deploy the decentralized CDN Dapp on a suitable blockchain platform or peer-to-peer (P2P) network.</s>
   - Integrate the Dapp with existing content delivery systems to enable seamless migration and interoperability.
   - Establish connections with content providers and onboard them onto the decentralized CDN network.
   - Implement monitoring and analytics tools to track the performance and usage of the Dapp.

### 6. Community Engagement and Governance
   - <s>Foster a community of participants and stakeholders interested in the decentralized CDN Dapp.</s>
   - <s>Establish governance mechanisms to ensure transparency, accountability, and decision-making within the network.</s>
   - <s>Encourage active participation and contribution from network participants through incentives and rewards.</s>
   - <s>Continuously gather feedback and iterate on the Dapp based on user experiences and evolving requirements.</s>
